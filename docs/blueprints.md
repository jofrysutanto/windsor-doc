# Blueprints

## What are blueprints?

Unlike other field types, Blueprint is a custom field type introduced by Windsor, and not by ACF. Blueprints share some similarities with Clone fields, which lets you re-use your fields, but offer a few more advantages in that:

- it lets you modify each cloned fields attributes
- it is easier to resolve the right field names to use
- it provides easier way to include/exclude and re-order cloned fields
